This porfolio project displays all of my previous JavaaScript projects, and was created using:
-JavaScript
-Node.js
-Express
-Pug
-CSS

The home page includes links to each project, and a breif introduction to the portfolio.
Each project, when clicked, contains detailed imagery, github repository links, and a link to a live demo.
The about page details my story  on how I came about Software Development, and my plans for my future.

Error handlers were added to configure customized global and 404 error pages.
This portfoilo will run the app, by simply adding npm start into the terminal.

NewRelic is used to monitor this app's data, error rate, throughput aand transactions time.

CSS styles to look out for:
-Font-family used is: 'Roboto Slab', serif
-transition to scale(1.1) when hovering over images on the home page, header turns darker shade of blue
-box links invert color when hovered over
